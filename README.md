# DialogueRNN
DialogueRNN is a ML Project which propose a machine learning solution to detect emotions in written-text using Neural Networks Concept. In our study case, we implemented a RNN Model to train the data. For Preprocessing, the proposed framework uses Glove Network for Vocabulary construction.
